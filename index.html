    <p>lock-modify-unlock:
    1 person can work on a project at a time, 
    the programmer must check a file out before it
    can be modified while this file is checked out no one can make any changes to it until it is checked back in. 
    This can be a problem in large projects it it may cause delay 
    when one person is taking to long on a specific feature.
